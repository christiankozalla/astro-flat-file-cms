## DB docs

The following JSON structure was initially planned, but is not implemented yet! The Database rather consists of txt-files, that hold the records line-by-line.

The Database consists of JSON files.

### Users

`users.json` holds all user login data like the following exammple Structure

```json
{
  "base-64-encoded-email": {
    "pw": { "iv": "some-hash", "content": "some-other-hash" },
    "name": "Username"
  }
}
```

To ensure "findability" of records, we need to follow some conventions:

1. The user's email will always be processed base-64 encoded. Not for security reasons, of course, but for string matching to find a record by email.
2. So the client needs to send the email already base-64 encoded to the server, for convenience.


### Sessions

Sessions will be stored in `sessions.json`

```json
{
  "base-64-encoded-email": {
    "token": "full-session-cookie",
    "validUntil": "ISOTimestamp"
  }
}
```


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
